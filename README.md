## Tag
Increase UDP if possible

Test ADC on myoware

<strike>Add DMA to get ADC even faster</strike>
>tag already runs satisfactorily at 50Hz, DMA may be interesting for reducing power consumption but is beyond the scope of this project ;)

Can/should we oversample and rudimentally process that to send packets with more information? Or send larger packets with oversampled frames?
>implemented oversampling/averaging @ 3 samples, tested working on the tag at 90Hz for an average of 30Hz

## Python
ML/Process datastreams from tags

Add game code to myogame.py

Integrate clean control signal

Configuration of player/tag

(Multiplayer or mutlisense?)

Graphical display at least for troubleshooting-debugging

## Presentation
We should probably rehearse
